This prototype of an Health Provider Directory (HPD) is part of the national electronical health record solution of Switzerland.
The institute of medical informatics developed this prototype on behalf of <a href="http://www.e-health-suisse.ch">eHealthSuisse</a>.

The project contains tree parts:

1. Interceptors to add additional checks to an <a href="https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/">Apache Directory Server</a>.
2. A minimal client for an example implementation of the webservice.
3. The HPD webservice (Developed in close collaboration with the <a href="https://www.post.ch/de/privat">POST AG</a>)

Be aware that this project is still under development and there is no warrenty at all.
